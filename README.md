This project allows you to train the model used in the code using your Persian dataset which has positive, negative, neutral labels and then test on another dataset.
Things to pay attention to:
* Your file must be in Persian
* The file format must be Excel
* Look at the code and use the names used for the columns
enjoy!!!

* pay attention to:
Your file must be in Persian
* Follow the steps below to execute your file with the code
1. The file format must be Excel
2. Look at the code and use the names used for the columns
3. Then upload your file to your Google Drive according to how it is addressed in the code
4. If you do not need the 'file.drop' commands, delete them
